**describe the issue**
...

**steps required to get this issue to occur**
... 

**what client are you using**
... (the version of the theme & what discord build you're on (listed at the bottom of the sidebar in user settings, looks something like "Stable 123456" and the theme info should be above it e.g. "DTM-08 V2 Build 1234"), and whether you're on desktop discord, web discord, using client mods with specific plugins enabled, etc.)

**confirm the following:**
- [ ] updating discord (or browser/client/client mod) did not fix it
- [ ] it was not caused by another theme
- [ ] it was not caused by custom css
- [ ] i am not using an extremely obscure client or client mod and i am not using an extremely outdated operating system
